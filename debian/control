Description: type-safe Signal Framework for C++ - runtime
 This library implements a full callback system for use in widget
 libraries, abstract interfaces, and general programming. It provides
 the ability to connect an abstract callback to a class method,
 function, or function object, and contains adaptor classes for the
 connection of dissimilar callbacks.
 .
 These are the runtime files for libsigc++, needed only if you wish to
 run software which depends on it.
